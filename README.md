# How to use the Discord Cookie-Bot

# This is a beta version of the bot. It may not work!

This is a money discord bot, made using python. In order to use it, you must have **python3.6** or higher installed, and the python modules **discord.py** and **pandas**. In order to run it, make sure that all the files are in the same location, and then run the python file. As long as the file is open, the bot will run.

You must also make a discord bot application on the discord website and replace ***YourTokenHere*** at the bottom of the **CookieBot.py** file with your bot token. You will also need to get the user id of your bot and replace ***bot_id*** at the top of the **accounts.py file**
